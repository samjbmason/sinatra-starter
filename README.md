Sinatra Starter
===============

There is not much to say here. Sinatra is awesome for small projects, in fact I prefer it even when building small static sites these days.
## Install
To get started download the zip, cd into the folder, run `bundle install --path vendor/bundle` from the terminal (this will install all your gems to a folder within your project, I like it that way rather than cluttering up the global gems).

## Run
The to get the server up and running simply type `bundle exec shotgun`

Still trying to figure out if there is way of not having to run `bundle exec` for all the executable commands.
